# conception_intro_data

Please clone this repo, create a branch for yourself, and then explore the scRNAseq data from this[https://www.science.org/doi/epdf/10.1126/science.abe0237] paper. Data is provided in the data directory as an RDS for a monocle3 object holding unprocessed matrices + metadata. 

Please perform the following tasks and present your work product as a knitted RMD (knit to html). 
  1. Preprocess and cluster the data - annotate decisions in the RMD.
  2. Roughly label celltypes -- this should include at least granulosa, soma, and germ cells. Can you get any more specific? Are there other additional celltypes? Show plots supporting your celltype labels. 
  3. How do celltypes compare across ages or across in vivo/in vitro samples? (open ended) 

Submit by pushing to your code & html files to your branch. 

We suggest to not spend more than ~3hrs total on this. Feel free to explore beyond the starter questions here -- find anything particularly interesting? Let's discuss!
